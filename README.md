### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I was working with many different files, switching between screens and different projects.
At one point, I messed up one file name and it took me over 40 minutes to figure the problem out.
Other than that, the project was very straightfoward, educational, and fun.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

This assignment was a step from the prework. Using cocoapods, homebrew, and importing packages
were entirely new iOS fundamentals to me. Syntax problems arose quite often, which stopped
the flow of progressing through the project. Even though I had a few difficulties, I utilised
the teaching assistants to help me finish my project. Great learning experience!
